# DSA-Projects

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Projects repository! This is a collection of projects where I explore various DSA concepts and algorithms.

## Overview

- Project 1: Task Management System using Arrays
 - Description: This project implements a simple Task Management System in Python using arrays. It allows users to add, remove, and display tasks.
  - Key Data Structures and Algorithms:
    - Array: Used to store tasks.
    - Methods: Implemented methods for adding, removing, and displaying tasks.
      
- Project 2: Word Occurrence Highlighter
 - Description: This project implements a Word Occurrence Highlighter in Python. The program allows users to input a text and a target word, and it highlights all occurrences of the 
                target word in the text. Additionally, it counts and displays the total number of occurrences.
  - Key Data Structures and Algorithms:
    - String
  - Key Features:
    - Highlighting: The program highlights occurrences of the target word in the input text.
    - Counting: It counts and displays the total number of occurrences of the target word.
      
## How to Use

1. Enter a text when prompted.
2. Enter the word you want to highlight.
3. The program will output the modified text with highlighted occurrences and the total count.

## How to Navigate

- Each project has its own folder.
- Navigate to a specific project's folder to find project-specific details.
- Explore the code, documentation, and any additional resources provided.
